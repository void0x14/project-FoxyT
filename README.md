# SNRR_GME-Protocol // Void0x14
## Cyber Terrain Mapping & Predictive Breach Orchestrator

**Status:** Theoretical Framework / Phase 0x00 (R&D)
**Target Engine:** Python 3.14 (Dev/Experimental) - Leveraging `Tail Call Optimization` & `Enhanced JIT`

---

## 🏗️ The SNRR_GME Core Architecture

- **[S]hadow-Discovery:** High-entropy reconnaissance using recursive SSL/TLS transparency logs and multi-vector DNS expansion.
- **[N]etwork-Pulse:** Sub-packet level socket manipulation using `raw-sockets` to bypass kernel-level firewall hooks.
- **[R]econ-Intelligence:** Real-time data synthesis from distributed intelligence nodes (Shodan, Censys, GreyNoise, CriminalIP).
- **[G]od-[M]ode-[E]ngine:** A non-linear decision tree for calculating the "Path of Least Resistance" using graph-theory-based asset correlation.

## 🗺️ Execution Roadmap (The Conquest)

### Phase 0x01: Data Ingestion & OSINT Harvesting
- [ ] **Asynchronous API Hub:** Custom high-speed wrappers for Shodan/Censys using `httpx` and `uvloop`.
- [ ] **Phantom Asset Crawler:** Scrapers for certificate transparency logs to map cloud-edge footprints.
- [ ] **Data Model:** Implementing a Neo4j or NetworkX-based graph structure to store asset relationships.

### Phase 0x02: Advanced Network Orchestration
- [ ] **Raw-Socket Core:** Port scanning engine written in pure Python using `AF_PACKET` to avoid OS-level TCP fingerprinting.
- [ ] **TCP/UDP Stack Spoofing:** Custom packet crafting to bypass stateful firewalls (IDS/IPS Evasion).
- [ ] **Service De-masking:** Heuristic-based service identification on non-standard/obfuscated ports.

### Phase 0x03: The GME Logic (Vulnerability Correlation)
- [ ] **Live-CVE Mapping:** Real-time NVD/GitHub Advisory sync for instant fingerprint matching.
- [ ] **Exploit-Chain Visualization:** Identifying how a single low-level leak leads to critical infra pivot points.
- [ ] **$R_w$ Scoring:** Custom risk-weighting algorithm based on asset proximity to the core "God-Node".

### Phase 0x04: Lateral Movement Simulation (LMS)
- [ ] **Pivot-Point Analysis:** Theoretical mapping of lateral movement paths within discovered internal subnets.
- [ ] **Active Probe Logic:** Low-noise "heartbeat" probes to detect internal lateral availability without alerting SOC.

### Phase 0x05: Shadow C2 & Data Integrity
- [ ] **Headless Command & Control:** Remote orchestration via encrypted (AES-256-GCM) WebSocket channels.
- [ ] **Ephemeral Logging:** Utilizing Shamir's Secret Sharing to distribute encrypted logs across multiple nodes.

### Phase 0x06: Autonomous Response & Hardening
- [ ] **Proactive Patching Suggestions:** Turning the weapon into a shield by generating automated hardening scripts.
- [ ] **Final System Stress-Test:** End-to-end simulation of the protocol in isolated laboratory environments.

## ⚖️ Tactical Notice
Developed under the **Void0x14** doctrine. This is not a tool; it is a digital sovereignty protocol.
