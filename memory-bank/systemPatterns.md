# System Patterns

## Development Workflow
- **Atomic Commits**: Every change must be a single logical unit.
- **Memory Bank First**: Update documentation immediately after any change.
- **MCP Integration**: Use GitHub MCP for all remote operations.

## Project Structure
- `.agent/`: Automation and agent-specific rules.
- `memory-bank/`: Project state and context documentation.
